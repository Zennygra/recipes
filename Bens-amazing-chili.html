   <p><h4>After <em>years</em> of annoying Mr.Silverman, I decided to pull the trigger</h4></p>
   <p>I am finally writing down the <em>BASE</em> recipe and practices in which to make my chili. 
   <br>Additives will be listed at the end. These are based on what is on hand, how much you wish to impress, or health.
   <br> Again, this is the base recipe first, meaning that all variations are built upon this recipe, and adding all additions is near impossible to do at the same time without multiple crockpots.
   <br> Without further ado. The....</p>

<h3><strong><em>INGREDIENTS</em></strong></h3>
<p>.........</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><h2><strong>Nevermind, too much work</strong></h2></p>
<br>
<p>I'm just messing with you. I wouldn't do that to you.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong><em>Finally, the INGREDIENTS:</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cans of chili beans, drained</li>
    <li>2 cans of light or dark beans(preference or what is on hand), drained</li>
    <li>1 small can of tomato paste. </li>
    <li>1-2lbs. of ground beef</li>
    <li>Cumin</li>
    <li>Chili powder</li>
    <li>Onion Powder</li>
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>Worcestshire Sauce</li>
    <li>The will to measure with your heart</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><em>Alternative and Additional ingredients</em></strong></h3>
<p>These are things I like to use and their reasoning for listing</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spinach: 1 block of frozen straight into the pot, or one bag of fresh cooked down</li>
        <li>Bulb Garlic(powder substitute): 3-4 reguar bulbs or 2 Elephant garlic, thinly sliced straight into the pot</li>
        <li>Protein replacement/(1lb.)supplement: cooked before adding to pot. My favorite is roast</li>
        <li>Frozen vegetables: something healthy in it</li>
        <li>Rice. 1-1.5 cups of COOKED rice. This will thicken the chili substantially</li>
        <li>Green onions: 1 bunch, cooked in the pot</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce: A couple splashes to impart some flavor and saltiness</li>
      </ul>

<h3><strong><em>The closest thing I have to....STEPS</em></strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Drain the cans of beans and put into a crockpot set to high heat</li>
    <li>Empty tomato paste into pot</li>
    <li>A solid 4-6 shots of worschestire sauce</li>
    <li>Add cooked ground beef to pot</li>
    <li>mix throughly before adding spices</li>
    <li>Grab your cumin and start shaking it into the center of the pot<br>
    You will be creating a roughly three inch wide circle that is hard to see the sauce through it.</li>
    <li>leaving the cumin untouched, begin adding Onion powder until there is a layer covering the cumin</li>
    <li>Again, leave the spices untouched and then add the garlic powder.<br>
    You want to cover the whole pile in solid layer, making it hard to see the previous spices.</li>
    <li>Mix thoroughly and add any supplements or additives and mix again.</li>
    <li>Let sit on high heat for 4 hours or take down to low for 8 hours.</li>
    <li>Question your sanity of this recipe, and realize it doesnt matter, it tastes good. </li>
</ol>
