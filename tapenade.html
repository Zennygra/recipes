    <p>Tapenade is an olive heavy dip that is great spread on bread, 
        <br> or if you really like olive, straight from the spoon</p>
    <p><h3><strong><em>INGREDIENTS</em></strong></h3></p>

<ul>
    <li>1 can of black, pitted olives</li>
    <li>1 large Jar of green olives, stuffed or not. I don't care</li>
    <li>some form of garlic, powder, minced, or bulb</li>
    <li>Worcestshire sauce</li>
    <li>a jar of pepperoncinis</li>
    <li>Jalepenos or some varient. Fresh or pickled</li>
    <li>A willingness to measure with your heart</li>
    <li>If you're feeling brave: Capers</li>
    <li>Some form of bread, preferably a stiff form. Bruschetta or crackers</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><h2><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2></p>
<ol>
    <li>Drain can of black olives and add olives to food processor</li>
    <li>drain green olives and fill black olive can. Dump into processor, repeat a second time</li>    
    <li>do the same with de-stemmed pepperoncinis one time</li>
    <li>do the same with jalepenos, destem if fresh</li>
    <li>measure garlic with your heart, but I suggest no more than two regular bulbs of garlic. Powedered or minced garlic is roughly two tablesoons, or ten, however you feel </li>
    <li>Give two good splashes of Worcestshire Sauce</li>
    <li>roughly chop with the food processor</li>
    <li>add capers you little rebel</li>
    <li>pulse food processor a few more times until you have little chunks</li>
    <li>spread that stuff on some bread and gorge yourself. once youre done eat one more tablespoon's worth. You deserve it.</li>
</ol>
