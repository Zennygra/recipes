<p><strong><em><h3>THINGS YOU NEED</h3></em></strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A bowl</li>
    <li>A spoon, not a fork, a spoon</li>
    <li>Milk, I dont care what type. Im doing good keeping your attention this far</li>
    <li>Cereal....Ceereeal....Seereal.....no good spelling. Just pick one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok doing well? got your FOUR things to make this happen?</p>
<br
<h3><strong><em>Here is how to "Make" cereal.</em></strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place bowl on counter. So far so good?</li>
    <li>Open box of cereal....Cireall....Sireal, yeah still no good spellings.</li>
    <li>tilt open box, please tell me the plastic is open already, I dont need to do a tutorial for that right?</li>
    <li>Just in case.....pull on opposite sides of the plastic to tear a hole in the bag. </li>
    <li>go back to tilting the box, lets be clear though, the open end of the box. place edge of box above bowl and tilt until cereal falls into bowl</li>
    <li>STOP POURING BEFORE IT HITS THE TOP OF THE BOWL. Or when you feel you have enough. Or Don't, do whatever you want. Be happy</li>
    <li>put C.Reeall, nope doesnt work, put cereal away where you initially had it. I hope its some place hygenic...</li>
    <li>Open Milk lid. Usually this means turning the lid to the left(counter clockwise) until it comes off.</li>
    <li>Stop pouring milk before it spills over the edge, or causes the cereal to fall out, dont worry you can come back for more</li>
    <li>add spoon to bowl. the curved part goes into the bowl.</li>
    <li>you lift the spoon from the bowl to your mouth hole. Watch Little Nicky to learn method to eat.</li>
    <li>Enjoy, or paint the walls with it. whatever</li>
</ol>
